Modding hub for the Desktop Meadow, delivered to you by the SamHub/ResourceHub project.

## [View Fonts, Resource Packs, And Sprite Packs Here](rp/index/INDEX.md)

## What can I add to Meadow Land?
"Resource Packs" for now, AKA modifying the "FormContent" folder, or you can add sprites using the NatureSheet xnb file AKA "Sprite Packs"

No decompiling and making actual mods for now please!

## I have a feature in my wallpaper that I want birds to land on (a shelf, window ledge, etc.) , How can i do this?
Download [this](https://github.com/Moonaliss1/desktopmeadowtool/releases/download/v1/blank.pyw) python script by Moonaliss1.
Running the script will bring up a blank window. Resize this window to where you want the hitbox of the object to be, and when you're happy with the positioning, right click the window. the window will go invisible. When you want to close it, just locate it on your taskbar and hit the x.

Example:
