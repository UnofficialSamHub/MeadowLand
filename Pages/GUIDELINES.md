# The MeadowLand Guidelines ![birb](../assets/images/Birb.png)
## Resource Pack Guidelines
1. Do not submit packs without transparent backgrounds
2. Do not submit packs that are the same/identical to another pack
3. Do not submit low quality packs. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Packs with random images that do not fit into the Meadow format
- Packs without any effort put into them
4. Please also check that the pack works before submitting it, due to the way the meadow was made you are limited with the sprite size that you can use
