## I want to create my own Resource Pack

It's great that you are interested in making new themes for this program, thanks!
Feel free to share them with the community by sharing them on this site by creating a pull request yourself, or by asking someone else to do it.

Before you start working on a pack for MeadowLand, you'll be interested in reading the [MeadowLand Guidelines](GUIDELINES.md), specifically the Resource Pack Guidelines section.

If you want to use the MeadowLand Maker for easier creation, please take a look at [How to make a Resource Pack with MLM](help/RPMLM.md) instead.

### I want to modify the sprites

2. Modify it as you like it (Please bear in mind that the boundries at this time are fixed, it may take some trial and error to figure them out)
3. Add your new PNG to the folder

### I want to change the default green "Mail In" Background

1. Get the font that you want to use
2. Double click on it to open it

### How do I combine all of this into a pack?

1. Grab the template [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vq4JUMLq9LFSfUV0UEndjm1RdGEm-Oj5/view?usp=sharing)
2. Put it into the folder where all the other files are
3. Change lines 5 - 8 accordingly (only modify the file names not anything outside the "")
